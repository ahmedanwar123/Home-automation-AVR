# Home Automation using PIR Sensor and Relay Module

This repository contains a project for home automation using an AVR microcontroller, a PIR sensor, and a relay module to control a light bulb.

## Description

This project aims to automate home lighting by detecting motion using a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor and controlling the light via a relay module. When motion is detected, the relay switches on the light bulb, and it turns off after a specified period if no further motion is detected. The system is built around an AVR microcontroller, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution for home automation.

## Features

- **PIR Sensor Integration**: Detects motion to trigger the light.
- **Relay Module Control**: Switches the light bulb on and off.
- **AVR Microcontroller**: Core processing unit for the automation logic.

## Components

- PIR Sensor
- Relay Module
- AVR Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328P)
- Light Bulb
- Connecting Wires
- Power Supply
